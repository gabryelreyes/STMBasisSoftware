# STMBasisSoftware

This is my take on a basis software for the STM32F407VGT6, using the STM32Cube Framework and PlatformIO as IDE.
The objective is to create a core application that abstracts the most hardware-related elements, exposing only high-level methods for their control.

This project is not focused on production, but a personal effort for further learning the ways of the STM32 family, good programming practices, C, C++, and other similar concepts.

## Issues, Comments and Suggestions
If you find an error or you have a better take on any implementation, feel free to fork this repository and make a pull-request.I am always grateful for learning opportunities and healty discussions.
